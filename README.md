# STEMS
Stems is a model that utilizes the form-class segmented-profile equations for southern
pine and hardwood species created by A Clark III, R.A. Souter, and B.E. Schlaegel of
the Southeastern Forest Experiment Station (see Source[1] below).  The model currently includes six
southern pine species including Loblolly Pine, Slash Pine, Shortleaf Pine, Longleaf Pine,
White Pine and Virginia Pine. More speices can be easily added by updating the included database
with the model coefficients provided in Source[1].

# PURPOSE
This model is capable of predicting diameter at any height, height to any diameter and volume
between two heights along the stem.  This model can be used to ajdust inventory volumes, to
estimate stem taper, to analyze product merchandizing decisions, etc.
